The RTL code of dual RAM design is presented in Verilog. 
Two RAMs, ram1 and ram2, comprise the dual RAM. 
The control input signal, rnw, configures the two RAMs in write only mode and read only mode alternately.
For instance, a ‘high’ configures ram1 in write mode and ram2 in read mode and vice versa.
Once configured, the RAM in write mode gets all the eight locations writ- ten. 
Each location is of size 64 bits. The data is written row-wise. While reading a ROM, it is done column-wise. 
This arises owing to the order of computation of DCT mentioned earlier. 
The include statement identifies the single RAM design.
This is followed by the declaration of the dualram module and the listing of I/Os along with their identification.
The ‘wire’ and ‘reg’ signals are also identified. The dual RAMs, ram1 and ram2, are instantiated by invoking the ‘ram_rc’ module twice. 
The ‘switch_bank’ signal, which is the inverted signal of ‘rnw’, configures ram2 in read mode if rnw is high and in write mode if it is low.
Naturally, rnw configures ram1 in write mode for rnw = 1 and in read mode for rnw = 0. The RAM data output ‘do2 or ‘do1’ is registered after a clock cycle delay at the posi- tive edge of ‘clk_sys’. 
This delay is purposely introduced to keep pace with ‘romc’ design discussed in an earlier section.
